## Portfolio 1: Text Processing with Python
This program takes in an Excel file for processing. The file holds a Person's information, which is to be read and displayed in a more organized manner. The first name, last name, and middle initial of each person should be capitalized. The person's id and phone number should be in a standardized format. This information is then stored in a dict and can be displayed. The python file can be viewed [here](Homework1_mxk190048.py).
