## Overview of NLP
This document is an introduction to natural language processing (NLP). It can be viewed [here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Portfolio 1: Text Processing with Python
This program takes in an Excel file for processing. The file holds a Person's information, which is to be read and displayed in a more organized manner. The first name, last name, and middle initial of each person should be capitalized. The person's id and phone number should be in a standardized format. This information is then stored in a dict and can be displayed. The python file can be viewed [here](Homework1_mxk190048.py).

## Portfolio 2: Word Guess Game
This program takes in raw text and processes it. The important words are lemmatized and the nouns are separated. The 50 most commonly used nouns in the text will be used for a word guessing game. In this game, the user will have to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word they need to guess, they get a point. The python file can be viewed [here](Homework2_mxk190048.py).

## Portfolio 3: WordNet
This program demonstrates and explains some of the features of WordNet and SentiWordNet. It details some of the tools and algorithms within WordNet as well as applications for them. The file can be viewed [here](Homework3_mxk190048.py).

## Sentence Parsing
This file demonstrates different sentence parsing methods like PSG trees, dependency parses, and SRL parses. The file can be viewed [here](Sentence_Parsing-MXK190048).
