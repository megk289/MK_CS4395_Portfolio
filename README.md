Through this course, I gained a better understanding of NLP techniques from focusing on words and sentences to entire documents. I have worked with tools like tokenizers, WordNet, n-grams, web scrapers and text classification algorithms. Through these projects, I have applied all of these techniques in new ways. 

I have always been interested in the interactions between natural languages and computers. Applications that use NLP are fascinating and very important in modern society. Google Translate, Siri, and chatbots are all forms of NLP. As our world rapidly changes around us, it is essential that our technology adapts to it. Working with NLP techniques has only encouraged my interest in this field; to push the boundaries of how computers can make our lives easier. 

## Skills Page
This page details the technical and soft skills I have honed over the course of this semester. The page can be found [here](skills_mxk190048).

## Overview of NLP
This document is an introduction to natural language processing (NLP). It can be viewed [here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf).

## Text Processing with Python
This program takes in an Excel file for processing. The file holds a Person's information, which is to be read and displayed in a more organized manner. The first name, last name, and middle initial of each person should be capitalized. The person's id and phone number should be in a standardized format. This information is then stored in a dict and can be displayed. The python file can be viewed [here](Homework1_mxk190048.py).

## Word Guess Game
This program takes in raw text and processes it. The important words are lemmatized and the nouns are separated. The 50 most commonly used nouns in the text will be used for a word guessing game. In this game, the user will have to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word they need to guess, they get a point. The python file can be viewed [here](Homework2_mxk190048.py).

## WordNet
This program demonstrates and explains some of the features of WordNet and SentiWordNet. It details some of the tools and algorithms within WordNet as well as applications for them. The file can be viewed [here](Homework3_mxk190048.ipynb).

## Sentence Parsing
This file demonstrates different sentence parsing methods like PSG trees, dependency parses, and SRL parses. The file can be viewed [here](Sentence_Parsing-MXK190048.pdf).

## N-grams
The program creates unigram and bigram dictionaries for English, French, and Italian using a training corpus. Given test data, the program calculates the probability of a line being in English, French, and Italian. It then chooses the language with the highest probability and outputs it to a file. It also outputs the accuracy of language detection and the line numbers of misidentified items. Program 1 constructs the language model and program 2 calculates accuracy. The document includes more details about n-grams. The files can be downloaded from the zip file [here](Homework4_mxk190048.zip). 

## Web Crawler
This program builds a web crawler. It uses a starter url and "crawls" along a web of links to gather information. The information is scraped and the most important terms are taken from it. This is used to create a simple knowledge base. The document details the process of building the knowledge base. The files can be downloaded from the zip file [here](Homework5_mxk190048.zip).

## Text Classification 1
This program demonstrates the following algorithms as they are performed on a data set: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks. It examines the performance of each algorithm on the given data set. The file can be viewed [here](Text_Classification-MXK190048.pdf).

## Reading ACL Papers
This document summarizes the experiments done here: https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.23.pdf. The research paper being summarized discusses new approaches for dialogue disentanglement. The summary paper can be viewed [here](Reading_ACL_Papers-mxk190048.pdf).

## Chatbot
This program builds a chatbot based on Hamlet. The code can be found [here](main.py) and the report [here](Chatbot_Report.pdf)

## Text Classification 2
This program demonstrates the following algorithms as they are performed on a data set: the Sequential Model, RNNs, CNNs, and Embeddings. It examines the performance of each algorithm on the given data set. The file can be viewed [here](Text_Classification_2-MXK190048.pdf).
